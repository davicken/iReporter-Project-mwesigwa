* iReporter is a corruption reporting and awareness platform that seeks for government intervention.

* Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and
localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables
any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the
general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.

* A citizen that has encountered a corrupt transaction can raise concern to the government by creating a red-flag
* Also a citizen that has encountered a poorly constructed public service/ resource can raise concern to the government by calling the government intervention
